# WettersolProject

## Wettersol project description
In order to optimise the use of electricity produced by a house's solar panels, it is important to predict how much electricity will be produced the next day. If no energy is going to be produced tomorrow, it might be beneficial to charge the batteries. Otherwise, it might be more beneficial to charge an electric car or sell the electricity.
Therefore, our project is to predict how much electricity a house will produce based on past production, as well as weather data.

## Data
We add our external data, but since the company data is confidential you need to add it yourself to allow the program to run.
You need to add the company data at the root of the ***/data*** folder.

## Execution

Once you have add the company data, go into the ***/src*** folder and run the following command :

```python main.py```

or 

```python main.py [zip_code]```

The first one take the zip code : 55448

But if you want to try for another location you can replace [zip_code].
